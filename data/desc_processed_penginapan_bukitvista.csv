on a coastal cliff with hundreds of steps, we advise you not to check-in at night because it will be easier to get lost and difficult to see the direction. make sure your suitcase or luggage is light,

visit your villa. make sure your valuables are stored neatly. there’s not much in the kitchen. so it will be better to bring your own food or groceries and cook it in the kitchen. ✦ availability ✦
